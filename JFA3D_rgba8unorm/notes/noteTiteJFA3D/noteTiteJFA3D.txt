Data is mapped as 3D, but layed out as slices in 2D texture.
 - Structure is a lookup table.
 - There are 16 slices per row, then they will wrap to next row.
 - To keep things simple, shape dimension must be powers of 2.
 - Shape XY corresponds to slice XY size.
 - Shape Z is jumps between different slices.
 
In shader, positions may be represented as 2D, 3D or LUT.
 - 2D represents global position in surface texture.
 - 3D represents position in the shape.
 - LUT is 4D value, XY tells position in slice, ZW tell which slice.

Coordinate mapping data structure (both regular and reverse mapping).
 - RGB components	: stores XYZ coordinates of closest seed.
 - A component		: stores whether coordinate points to seed value, which is used during flooding passes.
